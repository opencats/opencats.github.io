      <h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>

      <dl class="faqs">
        <dt>Is it ready to download and run now with all the features?</dt>
        <dd>Yes! Some features will require customisation after installation - for example full-text resume search and ACL role setup can be amended after the fact, but the initial installation delivers the base functionality. </dd>

        <dt>When will the new version be available?</dt>
        <dd>Continuous development occurs on the project, and we will snapshot releases when it improves stability or adds new features.</dd>

        <dt>What operating systems will be supported?</dt>
        <dd>All current Linux distributions will continue to be supported, as are current WAMP/XAMP installations.</dd>
        
        <dt>How are new Vulnerabilities tracked and closed?</dt>
        <dd>Vulnerability announcements are made in the news section, however increased code scanning has resulted in more vulnerability detections in recent months - so we will publish a tracker with all known vulnerabilities against the most recent codebase and track the open/closed status. </dd>
