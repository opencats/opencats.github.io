## Urgent Security release

In response to an XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerability we have released OpenCats v0.9.4-3.

### Overview
OpenCats suffers from an unauthenticated xml external entity injection that allows remote users to read files on the underlying operating system.

Date Reported: 28 Jun 2019

### More information:
OpenCats XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

Remote users (job applicants) can upload docx or odt files to read files on the underlying operating system. A docx file will be used here, but odt files can be used as well since the same vulnerable functions in DocumentTotext.php are used to parse the files.

### Remediation
This problem has been fixed in version 0.9.4-3

We recommend that you upgrade your opencats instance asap.

If you wish to apply a fix instead, please [view the changes](https://github.com/opencats/OpenCATS/pull/440) which requires you to add a single line to /lib/DocumentToText.php

### Thanks
We are extremely grateful to Reginald Dodd for finding this vulnerability and notifying the OpenCATS project.
